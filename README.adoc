= Secured - Eclipse Vert.x Booster

IMPORTANT: This booster requires that you use link:https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on[Red Hat SSO] to issue access tokens for interacting with this booster and runs best when deployed on OpenShift. For more details on using this booster with a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/vertx-runtime.html[Eclipse Vert.x Runtime Guide].


== Run this Booster on a Single-node OpenShift Cluster
If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can also deploy your booster there. A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

IMPORTANT: You *MUST* link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/vertx-runtime.html#mission-secured-vertx[update the configuration of your single-node OpenShift cluster as detailed in the mission documentation] before you can deploy this mission. 


To deploy your booster to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:

. Log in and create your project.
